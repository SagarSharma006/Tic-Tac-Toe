# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game that's simple to learn and quick to play. The game is played on a 3×3 grid, where players take turns marking a square with their symbol — one uses X, the other O.
It is a winner condition. Get three of your symbols in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Draw Game condition. If all nine squares are filled and no one has lined up three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
